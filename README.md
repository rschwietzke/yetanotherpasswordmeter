# Yet Another Password Meter

## Introduction 
Yet Another Password Meter on GITHub is what is left form the previsouly used yetanotherpasswordmeter.com website. Is is basically the moved version from no-version control to really great version control.

## What does it do?
The meter is meant to motivate you to choose better passwords. It is an educational tool too.

## What does it not do?
It does not guarantee any safety, it does not 100% make passwords strong, because it cannot not read the content, just the pattern. It does not motivate you to pick a different password for another service... that is something you should do.
